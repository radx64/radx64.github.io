    "content": "For a long time, I had been toying with the idea of setting up my own blog. I imagined sharing my thoughts, ideas, experiences and making some my private notes helpful for someone else but I always found myself putting it off, unsure of where to start or how to do it. As someone who isn’t an experienced devops, the thought of creating and maintaining a website seemed daunting. But recently, I decided to finally take the plunge and set up a blog using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. It turned out to be a lot simpler than I expected - see README.md of this blog repository here.Hello, and welcome to my corner of the internet! My name is Radek, and this blog is where I’ll be jotting down my thoughts, ideas, and discoveries as I navigate the worlds of C++ development, DevOps practices, and everything in between. Whether it’s diving into programming challenges, exploring new tools, or reflecting on my experiences with automation and system administration, this space is my personal notebook.I’m still figuring things out as I go, so consider this blog a collection of my ongoing journey. I’ll be documenting my lessons learned, mistakes made, and the occasional breakthrough that helps me move forward. If something here helps you in your own development path, that’s fantastic! And if not, maybe you’ll just enjoy reading through my experiments and reflections. Either way, thanks for stopping by - I’m excited to share this journey with you."
